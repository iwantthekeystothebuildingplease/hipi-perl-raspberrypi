Version 0.32  - 26 April 2013
              - Added GPIO interrupt handling classes
              - Many fixes for HiPi::Device::GPIO::Pin
              
Version 0.31  - Unreleassed development version  

Version 0.30  - Unreleassed development version  

Version 0.29  - 23 April 2013
              - hipi-pud utility added to support setting of PUD resistors
              - set_pud method added to all HiPi::Pin modules allowing
                setting of pull up / pull down resistors from usercode.

Version 0.28  - 23 April 2013
              - bug fixes for HiPi::Device::GPIO::Pin

Version 0.27  - 08 April 2013
              - Using second I2C channel on P5 now tested and supported
              - HiPi::BCM2835::I2C now supports per-instance transfer rates
              - hipi-i2c utility extended to support en/disable of i2c buses
              - GPIO PAD 5 documentation and GUI App display had 3V3 and 5V0
                pins reversed.

Version 0.26  - 23 March 2013
              - Bug in HiPi::BCM2835::I2C->set_baudrate caused peripheral 1
                value to always be set regardless of peripheral specified.
              - Added i2c_write_error / bus_write_error to allow case where
                i2c error condition expected. e.g. when a device has a
                sofware reset and does not complete the i2c transaction
                when reset command is sent.
              - Standardised error handling across all three i2c interfaces.
              - HiPi::Interface::MPL3115A2 gains mode, active, oversample
                and now uses delay based on oversample rate.

Version 0.25  - 19 March 2013
              - fixed bug in hipi-i2c installation

Version 0.24  - 19 March 2013
              - Added hipi-i2c command line utility to allow none Perl code
                access to i2c commands.
              - All calls to external programs ( cat, echo etc. ) are now
                taint safe.
              - Installation now always does an apt-get update before 
                apt-get install (depedency list). My test builds
                often fail at dependency installation time if apt-get update
                is not executed. 
                
Version 0.23  - 18 March 2013
              - bug in i2c C code fixed.
              
Version 0.22  - 17 March 2013
              - Added i2c interface to HiPi::Device::I2C (in addition to SMBus)
              - Added HiPi::BCM2835::I2C - i2c using registers direcly
              - Added HiPi::Interface::MPL3115A2 - to demonstrate repeated
                start operation using HiPi::BCM2835::I2C
              - Updated all i2c using interface modules to accept smbus, i2c
                or bcm2835 backends
                
Version 0.21  - 12 March 2013
              - HiPi::Device::OneWire read bug fixed
              - PWM Pin setting fixed in Control App
